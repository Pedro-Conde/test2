        <h2>Pedro Monteiro Conde | INFP | ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·</h2>
        <p>Nice to meet you, Iâ€™m <span class="highlight">Pedro Conde</span>. Iâ€™m a <span class="highlight">New Media</span> student with a passion for all forms of design, from <span class="highlight">graphic</span> and <span class="highlight">web</span> to <span class="highlight">UX/UI</span>.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m driven by the desire to create meaningful <span class="highlight">visual experiences</span> that connect with people, whether through thoughtful UX design or expressive illustration. My goal is to merge storytelling with usability, crafting work that feels both <span class="highlight">intuitive</span> and <span class="highlight">emotionally resonant</span>.</p>
        <p>I want to use design as a tool not just for function, but for emotional impact. Iâ€™m especially interested in projects that blend <span class="highlight">creativity</span> and <span class="highlight">empathy</span>, where design solves problems, tells stories, and reflects the human experience in subtle, powerful ways.</p>

  <h1 class="about-title">Core Values & Personal Info</h1>
  <div class="personal-info-content">
    <p><strong>Empathy</strong> â€” I believe great design begins with deep listening. Whether Iâ€™m building a layout or sketching a character, I always try to understand the person on the other end â€” what they feel, what they need, and what they expect. My process is rooted in human connection, not just visuals.</p>

    <p><strong>Clarity</strong> â€” I value intentional communication. I aim to remove noise and focus on what truly matters: structure, flow, and message. Whether in UI design or illustration, I avoid visual clutter in favor of meaningful hierarchy, space, and storytelling.</p>

    <p><strong>Adaptability</strong> â€” Design isnâ€™t one-size-fits-all. I adapt quickly to new tools, styles, and feedback. Whether through collaboration or experimentation, I treat every challenge as a chance to learn and evolve while staying grounded in purpose.</p>

    <p>I want the things I create to feel valuable. Not just in how they look or function, but in how they resonate. Whether itâ€™s a digital interface or a single illustration, my goal is to make work that people connect with, reflect on, or carry with them in some way. If someone sees something Iâ€™ve made and feels like it matters, even a little, then Iâ€™ve done what I set out to do.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m currently seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute to real-world projects in UX, web, or visual storytelling. My goal is to apply my skills in a professional setting while continuing to grow as a designer and communicator.</p>

    "Besides arts, my biggest hobbies are playing video-games and listening to music, sometimes even both at the same time. This comes from my parents, who introduced me to both at a young age.",
    "First I was interested in visual arts, but recently I've been interested in writing and storytelling. One of my personal goals is publishing a graphic novel or comic, drawing and writing the entire thing.",
    "My passion for arts kept on developing, which led to me becoming interested in design and all of its areas. I've always been creative and imaginative, so I was motivated to become a designer since high school.",
    "I've been interested in illustrations ever since I was a child, all because of anime. I would draw my favorite characters all the time, until I decided to actually learn how to draw and make my own.",
    "I moved to Vancouver in 2021 with my family, when I was 15 years old and barely spoke English. Our initial plan was moving to France, then we changed to Canada and almost ended in Halifax.",
    "I was born and raised in Manaus, the capital city of the Amazonas province in Brazil. I was raised by my mom and my grandma, until the age of 11 when my mom met my stepfather. Four years later, our lives would turn upside down.",
