      <h2>How it came to life</h2>
      <p>
         Hiro was the first character I ever created. He was made way back in 2015, when I was only 8 years old.
         My best friend at the time, who was coincidentally also called Pedro, had the idea of making a comic, and asked me to design one 
        of the characters for him. That is when Hiro came to life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I was a child, I didn't really think too much about it and just did what I thought was cool, which led to nowadays Hiro being
         COMPLETELY different from the first version. But somehow, I got so attached to that character that I kept it with me, and turned it 
         into one of my OCs. My first OC.
      </p>
      <p>The name 'Hiro' was in reference to the character Hiro Hamada from the movie Big Hiro 6.
        And to be honest, I have no idea where the surname 'Mashida' came from. I just thought about a Japanese last name that sounded cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kind of based Hiro on me, so his personality matches mine. He's usually quiet and collected, but can be chaotic and talkative around
        the right people. He knows when to speak, and when to stay silent. Hiro pays tons of attention to the people around him, and is constantly
        trying to make the day of the ones he love. He likes to draw, listen to music, and birds. Especially owls. His favorite color is purple.
      </p>

      <h2>Inspirations</h2>
      <p>
         Recent designs of Hiro, including the latest redesign, were based on multiple K-pop artists and some actors. Hiro's hair was mostly inspired by Jung Kook from BTS and Jungwon from ENHYPEN, as well as some facial features such as eyes and face
        shape. Some features come from young Leonardo DiCaprio, especially eye color, skin tone, and even the hair in some way. Hiro is kind of
        a weird combination of caucasian and asian celebrities.
